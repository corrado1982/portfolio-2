          Hi, my name is Corrado Di Rofi, I studied art in Italy, first
          goldsmithing in high school, then decoration at the art academy in
          Rome then I have studied Frontend Development on Noroff School in
          Norway. My curiosity lead me to investigate and experiment in
          different fields, like technology art and music, and often interacting
          across them. I have different side projects, like animations, a tech
          you-tube channel and a punk band here in Norway (Cargokult) where I
          play the drums and I have produced the first album and co-produced the
          second one (wich will be released soon). I have also started a
          recording project with my old band in Italy (EP will be on Spotify
          14/11). My youTube channel it was an idea to help common people fixing
          small and simple technological problems of everyday life. The
          animation channel contain just a couple of videos and it started as a
          joke just to show to my small doughter that "also daddy can make a
          cartoon for you :D". I also promessed to myself that soon I will go
          back to an old project of a game controller that can be used with only
          one hand, so also people with particular difficoulties could play
          videogames. After the Front-end school I have experimented with some
          websites for friends and now I have this idea that i have to make a
          videogame similar to my favorite board game (Hotel).
